The Nsight Systems CLI supports concurrent analysis by using sessions. Each Nsight Systems session is defined by a sequence of CLI commands that define one or more collections (e.g., when and what data is collected). A session begins with either a start, launch, or profile command. A session ends with a shutdown command, when a profile command terminates, or, if requested, when all the process tree(s) launched in the session exit. Multiple sessions can run concurrently on the same system.
The remaining overheads are due to the necessary steps required to launch each graph on the GPU, and we expect to further reduce these with future improvements to CUDA. We intentionally don’t show any profile here since we are still working on CUDA Graph compatibility with the profiling tools. With the current CUDA release, the profile would look similar to that shown in the “Overlapping Kernel Launch and Execution” except there would only be one “cudaGraphLaunch” entry in the CUDA API row for each set of 20 kernel executions, and there would be extra entries in the CUDA API row at the very start corresponding to the graph creation and instantiation.  Each of these 20 kernels would still be shown as individual entries, but in order to provide such a picture, the profiler currently disables some graph-related optimizations. A more accurate profile would not disable any optimizations and represent each set of 20 kernels through display of a single graph entry.
