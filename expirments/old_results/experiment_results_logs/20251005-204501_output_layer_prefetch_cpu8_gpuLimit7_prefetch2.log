/workspace/./ktransformers/operators/experts.py:221: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.

This means writing to this tensor will result in undefined behavior. You may want to copy the array to protect its data or make it writable before converting it to a tensor.

### 问题陈述

求函数 \( f(x) = 3x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x - 1 \) 在区间 \([0, 2]\) 上的最大值和最小值。

### 解决步骤

#### 第一步：理解问题

我们需要在闭区间 \([0, 2]\) 上找到函数 \( f(x) \) 的最大值和最小值。对于连续函数在闭区间上的极值，可以通过以下步骤找到：
