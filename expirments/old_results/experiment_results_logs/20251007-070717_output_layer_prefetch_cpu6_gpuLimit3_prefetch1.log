/workspace/./ktransformers/operators/experts.py:221: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.

### 问题陈述

求函数 \( f(x) = 3x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x - 1 \) 在区间 \([0, 2]\) 上的最大值和最小值。

### 解决步骤

为了找到函数在闭区间上的最大值和最小值，我们可以按照以下步骤进行：

1. **求函数的导数**：首先，我们需要找到函数的导数 \( f'(x) \)，因为极值点通常出现在导数为零或导数
